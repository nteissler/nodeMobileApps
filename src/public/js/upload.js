//file for form validation and 
//checking that app names aren't already taken
//ajax call to check free name
//passcode box isnt active unless secure options are checked
//no submit until everything is filled


//maybe make a radio box where you can 
//check "updating" or "new"
//if you check updating, then the above form gets grayed out
//and you can put in release version and new notes


//any other suggestions?
